# 02 — Computed Values

Demonstrates MobX computed values: derived state that updates automatically and caches its result.

## Concepts

- **Computed getters** — `get total()` derives a value from observables
- **Caching** — computed values only recalculate when their dependencies change
- **Lazy evaluation** — computeds are only calculated when observed

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
